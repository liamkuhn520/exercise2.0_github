print("At any size of project, it is acceptable to begin using a version management software like Github, though the bigger the project, the more likely using it is going to be beneficial. If you program frequently, even if it is for several, small projects, having a reliable place to keep them backed up and all accessible from one location can save a lot of time and hassle in the future. Another time using Github would be considered useful is if the project is large enough that multiple people are working on it at the same time. Using the branch features found in Github, multiple individuals can all edit code simultaneously without actively changing the base source, making working on a project that large a lot more efficient. These branches can also be used to troubleshoot an idea, also without altering the main code and thus avoiding having to sift through it all to find any sort of errors. ")
